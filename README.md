### K-Means Clustering Shiny App for Motor Trend Car Test Data


### Description

This is code I wrote to experiment with Shiny app development and deployment. I would like to get more familiar and comfortable with Shiny, and used this simple, yet effective, app in experimenting with the different capabilities of the Shiny package.

The Shiny app gives the user 3 controls: choose X-axis variable, Y-axis variable, and the number of clusters, from 1-12.


### Required Packages

The following package is required to use the K-Means Clustering Shiny app: shiny.

 
### Interpreting the Results

Upon choosing the desired controls, there is a plot on the right side of the sidebar, depicting the given inputs. This allows clustering to happen on multiple variables of the Motor Trend data.
